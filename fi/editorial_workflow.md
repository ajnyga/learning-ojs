# Chapter 11: Editorial Workflow

In this chapter, you will follow as submission throughout the workflow, from first submission to final publication.

The workflow is divided into 4 stages:

**Submission**: This is where new submissions land while being assigned to Section Editors and considered for moving into the Review stage.

Some submissions are clearly inappropriate and never make it beyond this stage.

**Review**: This is where the peer review happens, as well as any revisions required by the author.

Some submission will not pass review and end here. Those that are accepted move to the next stage.

**Copyediting**: Accepted articles move to this stage, where they are improved by the work of a copyeditor. Authors can be given the opportunity to review the copyedits.

**Production**: Once the copyedits are completed and approved, the submission moves to this stage. In Production, the copyedited files are converted to galleys -- HTML, XML, PDF, etc. Again the author has the opportunity to proofread the galleys. Once everyone is satisfied, the submission is scheduled for publication in a future issue.
