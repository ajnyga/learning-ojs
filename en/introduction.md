# Chapter 1: Introduction

Open Journal Systems \(OJS\) is an open source solution to managing and publishing scholarly journals online. OJS is a highly flexible editor-operated journal management and publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on a local Web server.

It has been designed to reduce the time and energy devoted to the clerical and managerial tasks associated with editing a journal, while improving the record-keeping and efficiency of editorial processes. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of journal publishing through a number of innovations, including enhancing the reader experience, making journal policies more transparent, and improving indexing.

This book covers OJS version 3.1, released in October 2017, and features significant enhancements over the previous versions of the software. We hope you find it helpful for your publishing projects.
