##Components

When an author makes a submission, they can upload multiple files. Typically, one file will be the article text, and others can include interview transcripts, data, images, etc. Each of these files is a **component** of the submission. The components available for the author to choose from when making her submission are listed here.

Using the links provided, you can change the **Order** of the components (how they will be listed to the submitting author), **Add a Component** (if something you need is not included by default -- e.g., Video), or **Restore the Defaults** (if someone has made too many modifications and you just want to reset everything).

### Edit Component
You can also edit each component by selecting the blue arrow to the left of the component name. This will reveal an Edit link and a Delete link.
