# Copyediting

Once the submission is approved, it will automatically move to the Copyediting stage.

The notification let's you know that you must now add a copyeditor to the submission, using the *Add* link on the Participants list.

This will open a new window.

![](learning-ojs-3-ed-copyediting-add.png)

You can use the role dropdown to choose Copyeditor and hit the Search button. This will bring up all copyeditors.

Select one of the copyeditors for this submission.

Choose a prepared message.

Make any changes needed to the message.

Hit **Send**.

You can now see the new notification that the submission is awaiting copyedits, the copyeditor is now included in the Participants list, and the request is visible in the Copyediting Discussions.

You can now wait for the copyeditor to do her work.

##Copyeditor

The copyeditor will receive an email message from the section editor requesting her to take on the submission.

To get started, she must login and find the submission from her dashboard.

Then, she can click the Copyediting link next to the submission name. This will take her directly to the Copyediting stage for this submission.

From here, she can see the Draft Files. These are the files that require copyediting. Clicking on the linked title will download the file to her desktop.

Outside of OJS, she will do her copyediting work. 

###Consult with the Author

Once she has finished copyediting, she will run the changes past the author by adding a new discussion, using the Copyediting Discussions panel's *Add discussion* link.

From the Add Discussion window, she must choose the author and add a subject line and message.

Further down that same window, she must upload a copy of her copyedited file.

To do so, use the *Upload File* link. This will open a new window where you must choose the *Article Component* (e.g., article text) and upload the file.

Hit **Continue** to proceed.

This will open the next step, where you can edit the filename if needed.

Next, you can upload more files if necessary, or hit **Complete**.

Back on the Add window, you can now see the attached file.

![](learning-ojs-3-ce-upload4.png)

Hit **OK** to send the message to the author.

It is now visible in the Copyediting Discussions.

![](learning-ojs-3-ce-discussion.png)

You can now wait for the author's response.

##Author Responds

Once you hear back from the author, you can review his feedback by checking the discussion reply.

From here, you can see no further changes are required.

##The Final Copyedited File

Now you can go ahead and upload the final copyedited version to the Copyedited panel, near the bottom of the screen.

![](learning-ojs-3-ce-copyedited.png)

Use the Upload/Select Files link to upload the final copyedited version.

![](learning-ojs-3-ce-copyedited-upload-select.png)

It is important to note here that you have a few choices.

1. You can use the Upload File link to upload a new file (e.g., a file with some recent changes since you showed it to the author).
2. You can select the Author's original version (unlikely).
3. You can select the Copyeditor version, which is the version you sent to the author (if you made no further changes, choose this one).

For this demonstration, we will select the Copyeditor version by checking the box to the left of that file.
