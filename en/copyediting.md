This will open a new window.

You can use the role dropdown to choose Copyeditor and hit the Search button. This will bring up all copyeditors.

Select one of the copyeditors for this submission.

Choose a prepared message.

Make any changes needed to the message.

Hit **Send**.

You can now see the new notification that the submission is awaiting copyedits, the copyeditor is now included in the Participants list, and the request is visible in the Copyediting Discussions.

You can now wait for the copyeditor to do her work.

##Copyeditor

The copyeditor will receive an email message from the section editor requesting her to take on the submission.

To get started, she must login and find the submission from her dashboard.

Then, she can click the Copyediting link next to the submission name. This will take her directly to the Copyediting stage for this submission.

From here, she can see the Draft Files. These are the files that require copyediting. Clicking on the linked title will download the file to her desktop.

Outside of OJS, she will do her copyediting work. 

###Consult with the Author

Once she has finished copyediting, she will run the changes past the author by adding a new discussion, using the Copyediting Discussions panel's *Add discussion* link.

From the Add Discussion window, she must choose the author and add a subject line and message.

Further down that same window, she must upload a copy of her copyedited file.
