The system generates reports that track the details associated with site usage and submissions over a given period of time. Reports are generated in CSV format which requires a spreadsheet application to view.

**View Report**: Provides a report on galley and abstract views by readers (i.e., how many times a PDF for an article has been viewed).

**Articles Report**: Provides a spreadsheet of all published articles.

**Review Report**: Provides a spreadsheet of all review activity.
