This opens a new window, where the reviewers are listed and can be selected, one at a time.

Note the details visible about the reviewers, including their interests, past assignments, etc.

At the bottom of this form, you will see options to:

**Select Reviewer**: Use this once you have picked a reviewer.

**Create New Reviewer**: If none of the reviewers are suitable, you can use this button to create a new reviewer. This is a new account in the system.
