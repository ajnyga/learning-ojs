##Making the Decision

Options include:

**Request Revisions**: This will require the Author to make minor changes, but no further peer review is required.

**Resubmit for Review**: This will require the Author to make major changes and another round of review will need to take place.

**Send to Copyediting**: This means the submission is accepted without revisions and can proceed to the Copyediting stage.

**Decline Submission**: This means that the submission has not passed peer review and is unsuitable for further consideration. The submission would then move to the Archives.

##Request Revisions
In this demonstration, we are going to request that the Author make some minor revisions before acceptance.

To do so, select the **Request Revisions** button. This results in a new message window.

You can modify any of the text before sending the message.

Use the **Add Reviews** button to import the Reviewer's comments from the Editor and Author field. Comments in the Editor only field will not be displayed.

You must now wait for the Author to respond with her revisions.

##Author Responds
