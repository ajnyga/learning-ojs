There are spaces to add volume, number, year, and title information (e.g., Special Issue #1), as well as a description and a cover image (if needed).

###Edit Issue
You can also edit an existing future issue by selecting the blue arrow to the left of the issue entry on the Future Issues page. This will reveal an Edit link, which will open a similar form window as seen above.
