## Subscription Types

The first step in setting up subscription management is to designate the types of subscriptions the journal offers. Journals typically offer individual subscription and institutional subscription rates. Some journals may have special offers for members of an organization or students. OJS will support the management of print and/or online subscriptions. More than one type of subscription can be created to cover longer periods of time \(12 months, 36 months\).
