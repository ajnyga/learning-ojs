Institutional subscriptions are managed similarly to individual subscriptions, but are used for libraries, research institutes, and other organizes that subscribe to your journal.

You can create a new individual subscription by using the Create New Subscription link. First, however, you will need to create a new account for the institution's contact person under Users & Roles \(see Chapter 7\). Once that is done, you can search for the account here, and apply the different configurations.
