# Editorial Interface

OJS 3 now has a separate interface once you log into the editorial system. This makes it easier to customize the reader interface, but also provides OJS users of different journals a consistent experience.

The editorial interface is known as your **dashboard** and consists of the following elements:

1. Upper Left Corner: Here you will find the name of the journal you are currently working with (e.g., Journal of Public Knowledge). If you are enrolled in more than one journal on this OJS installation, you can use this to switch between journals.
2. Upper Right Corner: From here, you can switch languages if the journal is multilingual, view the reader interface, or click on your username to view your profile [link] or logout.
2. Left Menu: These are the major sections of the dashboard, including your tasks (items needing immediate attention), the submissions, issue management, settings, user and role management, and tools.
3. Main Panel: In the main panel you will see the current work area. In the image above, you are looking at Submissions.
4. Right Panel: From here, you can see action buttons, such as New Submission. Different pages have different action buttons.
