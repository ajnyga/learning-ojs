Depending the journal, you may be required to approve copyedits. You will be notified in the system that you have pending copyedits.

The copyediting stage is mainly managed through the discussion feature.  You can respond to or  approve copyedits via the discussion dialogue box. You can also upload revised files if necessary.

When you have approved the copyedits, the editor will send the file to the production stage. You will receive a notification email when it moves to this stage.
