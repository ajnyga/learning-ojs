**Journal Name** is the name of your journal. E.g., Journal of Software Documentation

**Journal Initials** are the initials of the journal. E.g., JSD.

**Journal Abbreviation** is the abbreviation of your journal name. E.g., JSoftDoc.

**Publisher** is the name of the organization publishing the journal.

**ISSN** (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-digit number which identifies journals. It is managed by a world wide network of National Centres coordinated by an International Centre based in Paris, backed by Unesco and the French Government. A number can be obtained from the [ISSN web site](http://www.issn.org/). This can be done at any point in operating the journal.

OJS journals will typically have an online ISSN, but some may also publish a print version, which requires a different print ISSN.

**Journal Summary** is a brief description of your journal. If you are on an OJS installation with multiple journals, this text will appear with your journal listing.

**Masthead** allows you to add the names of your editorial team or anyone else you wish to mention. This will appear on the public website under About > Editorial Team.
