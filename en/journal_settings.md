##Masthead

**Journal Name** is the name of your journal. E.g., Journal of Software Documentation

**Journal Initials** are the initials of the journal. E.g., JSD.

**Journal Abbreviation** is the abbreviation of your journal name. E.g., JSoftDoc.

**Publisher** is the name of the organization publishing the journal.

**ISSN** (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-digit number which identifies journals. It is managed by a world wide network of National Centres coordinated by an International Centre based in Paris, backed by Unesco and the French Government. A number can be obtained from the [ISSN web site](http://www.issn.org/). This can be done at any point in operating the journal.

OJS journals will typically have an online ISSN, but some may also publish a print version, which requires a different print ISSN.

**Journal Summary** is a brief description of your journal. If you are on an OJS installation with multiple journals, this text will appear with your journal listing.

**Masthead** allows you to add the names of your editorial team or anyone else you wish to mention. This will appear on the public website under About > Editorial Team.

**About the Journal** is a space to add any information about your journal which may be of interest to readers, authors, or reviewers. 

This could include your open access policy, the focus and scope of the journal, copyright notice, sponsorship disclosure, history of the journal, a privacy statement, and inclusion in any LOCKSS or CLOCKSS archival system.
