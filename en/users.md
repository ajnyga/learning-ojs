# Users

In addition to managing the journal web site, the Journal Manager is also responsible for all of the user accounts in the system.

To view the user accounts, select Users & Roles from the left menu.

##Users

Users are displayed in last name order.

You can edit a user account by selecting the blue arrow to the left of an entry.

This opens the options to Email, Edit User, Disable, Remove, Login As, Merge User.

**Email** opens a window allowing you to quickly send a message to that user.

**Edit User** allows you to make changes to that user's account.

**Disable** keeps the account in place, but blocks the user from accessing it.

**Remove** clears the user account out of your journal records and the user can no longer login, but the account remains in the system.

**Login As** allows you to temporarily log in as that user, for example, to complete an outstanding task.

**Merge User** lets you fold this user account, including any submissions or assignments, into another user account on your system. 


> **Note**: This is the only way to completely delete an account from the system.

You may want to create a dummy user account (e.g., Deleted Users), and use that to merge unwanted accounts into.
