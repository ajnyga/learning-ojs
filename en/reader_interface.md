# Reader Interface

By default, Open Journal Systems is installed with a very simple, functional user interface. This includes a top header, navigation bar, navigation blocks to the right, and a main content block in the middle of the page.

The following image is a screenshot of an OJS Demonstration Journal Table of Contents.

You can see from the screenshot that the user functions now exist from your profile menu at the top right of the screen. This takes the managerial content in OJS 3.x away from general user view. Side bar information is clearly broken out, as well as your top navigation bar with collapsible menus for the "About" functions. Like OJS 2, each article has a linked title for viewing object metadata and abstracts, and galleys are now clearly labeled below the titles with clearer logos.
