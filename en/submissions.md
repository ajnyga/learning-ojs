# Submissions

When an author makes a new submission to your journal, the editor is automatically emailed. When you log into your Dashboard, you can find it either from your Tasks, or by looking in one of the queues.

##My Queue
This page is divided into 3 sections:

**Unassigned**: This includes submissions added to sections without section editors.

**My Assigned**: This includes submissions added to sections where you are a section editor.

**My Authored**: This includes submissions that you wrote, and should be assigned to a different editor.

The **Search** tool for each queue can sometimes be helpful in tracking down submissions.

##Active
This section includes a list of all submissions, without being organized into queues.

##Archived
This section includes a list of all submissions either rejected or already published by the journal.

##Our Submission
For this demonstration, we are looking for the Mishkin submission, entitled *Approach for externalization of expert tacit knowledge*. It can be found in the **Unassigned** queue, as well as at the bottom of the Active list.

Once you find the submission, you can use the blue arrow to reveal options to **Delete** or find **More Information**.

Deleting will remove the submission and More Information will bring up the submission's history.

##Submission Record
To view the submission in more detail, select the Submission link to the right of the title. This will take you to the submission record.

From here, you can see:

**Submission Files**: In this case, there is just one file, but multiple files have been submitted.

**Pre-Review Discussions**: This tool allows me as the editor to communicate with the author, or with others on the editorial team. For example, to ask the author for some additional information, or to ask a section editor to take responsibility for this submission.

**Participants**: From here, I can see the submission author's name. Other names will appear here as they become involved with the submission.

##Assigning the Submission

To move the submission forward, the next step is to assign an editor or section editor. To do so, select the *Add* link in the Participants list.
