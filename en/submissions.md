# Submissions

When an author makes a new submission to your journal, the editor is automatically emailed. When you log into your Dashboard, you can find it either from your Tasks, or by looking in one of the queues.

##My Queue
This page is divided into 3 sections:

**Unassigned**: This includes submissions added to sections without section editors.

**My Assigned**: This includes submissions added to sections where you are a section editor.

**My Authored**: This includes submissions that you wrote, and should be assigned to a different editor.

The **Search** tool for each queue can sometimes be helpful in tracking down submissions.

##Active
This section includes a list of all submissions, without being organized into queues.
