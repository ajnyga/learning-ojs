# Submitting an Article

**Login** to the system. You will be taken to your dashboard. It will be empty as you have made no submissions.

Start a new submission by clicking the ‘**New Submission**’ button on the right side of the screen.

From here, you will be taken to **Step 1** of a 5-Step process to upload and describe your submission. To begin select the appropriate section for your submission (e.g., article, review, etc.). If you aren’t sure which section is appropriate, make your best guess. Read and agree to the statements in the submission checklist by checking each box. Include any comments for the editor, read the journal’s privacy statement, and then click the **‘Save and Continue**’ button to move to **Step 2**.

On **Step 2**, a window will open allowing you to upload your submission file.

First, however, you MUST select an Article Component. This lets the system know whether the file is the body of the manuscript, an image, a data set, etc. **This must be selected before your file will upload**.

Once you’ve made that selection, you can then upload your first file. It is important to note that you can only upload **one** file at a time. Additional files can be uploaded later in the process. Typically, this first file will be the body of your manuscript. Hit the **Continue** button once the file uploads.

> Note: we’re currently looking at replacing this upload tool with something more user-friendly.

After uploading the file, you will be asked to name the file. To ensure a blind review, do not include any identifying information in your filename. Click the ‘**Continue**’ button.

In ‘Finishing up’ you have the option to repeat the process to upload additional files (e.g., a data set or an image). 
Once you have finished uploading all of your files, click ‘**Complete**;’ this will close the upload window.

You will be brought back to the ‘submit an article screen’ where you will see the files you’ve uploaded. If you need to make changes, expand the arrow and make any changes using the ‘Edit Metadata’ link. 

Click ‘Save and Continue’ to move to Step 3.

On **Step 3**, you will be asked to add more information about the submission, including the title of the submission (broken down into prefix, title, and subtitle), the abstract, and scrolling down...

...any additional contributors.

Depending on the journal you are submitting to, you may see additional fields to complete. 
 
Click ‘**Save and Continue**’ to move forward.

> Note: We’re currently exploring how many of these metadata fields to display by default, if some should be hidden unless a Journal Manager enables them, etc. We’re trying to find the balance between the journal’s need for detailed metadata and the author’s need for a pleasing user experience.

On Step 4, you will be asked to confirm that you are happy with your submission.
